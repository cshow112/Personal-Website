      <p>
        I’m Calder Shogren-Knaak, a Computer Science student at The University of Wisconsin Madison. I’m currently still exploring my interested and have no particular specialization. Meaning my projects are fairly all over the place. I am most comfortable with Java, C, and C++, but have had some practice with Swift, Javascript, and if you count them HTML and CSS. Besides programming I quite like literature, film, TV, and music (for recs. Check out the about page). I am also an avid enjoyer of tennis, badminton, ping pong, and rock climbing. My belief is that happiness and fulfillment are found through intentionality and effort. By questioning life and finding the beauty within it.

        <blockquote>“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer."</blockquote> </p>
